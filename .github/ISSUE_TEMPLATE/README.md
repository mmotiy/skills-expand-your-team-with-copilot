## How to Use These Templates

1. **Go to the Issues tab** in the GitHub repository
2. **Click "New Issue"**
3. **Choose the template** that best matches your need
4. **Fill out all required fields** - the more detail you provide, the better!
5. **Submit the issue** - our Copilot coding agent will be automatically assigned

## Tips for Better Results

### ‚úÖ Do This:
- **Be specific**: Instead of "improve the interface", say "add color coding to show activity capacity status"
- **Provide examples**: Reference similar features from other websites or apps you like
- **Include context**: Explain why the change is needed and who will benefit
- **Fill out all required fields**: This ensures the Copilot has all necessary information

### ‚ùå Avoid This:
- Vague descriptions like "make it better" or "fix the problems"
- Requesting multiple unrelated changes in one issue
- Skipping required fields or acceptance criteria
- Assuming technical knowledge - explain in teacher-friendly terms

## Getting Help

If you're not sure which template to use:

- **Start with your goal**: What do you want to accomplish?
- **Check existing activities**: Is this about something that already exists (modify) or something new (add)?
- **Consider the scope**: Is this a small fix (bug report) or a big new feature?

Still not sure? Create a **Feature Request** and explain your situation - we can always adjust from there!

## What Happens Next?

After you submit an issue:

1. **Automatic assignment**: The Copilot coding agent will be assigned to your issue
2. **Analysis**: The agent will analyze your requirements and create an implementation plan
3. **Development**: The agent will write and test the necessary code changes
4. **Review**: Changes will be tested to ensure they meet your requirements
5. **Deployment**: Once approved, changes will be applied to the live system

You'll receive notifications at each step, and you can always comment on the issue if you need to clarify or add information.
